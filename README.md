# Solar System Simulation with Three.js

Welcome to the Solar System Simulation project developed by **Equipe 08**. This project leverages the Three.js API and concepts of Computer Graphics to create a 3D simulation of our Solar System. In this documentation, you will find information on how to run the project, its requirements, optional features, dependencies, and a link to a video demonstration.

## Requirements <a name="requirements"></a>

The project aims to create a 3D simulation of the Solar System. Here are the key requirements:

- [x] Use of geometric transformations and textures for each celestial body.
- [x] Present the objects referring to the planets and the sun.
- [x] Apply the maximum number of objects referring to the Solar System in the scene (Saturn can present its rings with the same texture resource shown in the classroom, but the satellites of each of the planets will be disregarded for this work).
- [x] Apply the translation of the planets around the Sun (using keys for user interaction).
- [x] Planets should perform their own rotation around themselves.
- [x] Include the project on GitHub and add a link to a video demonstration on YouTube showing the operation of the 3D scene.

## Optional Features <a name="optional-features"></a>

The following optional features have been implemented and are part of the project:

- [x] Efficient representation of Saturn's rings.
- [x] Representation of some satellite samples.
- [x] Planets move at different speeds.
- [x] Trigger keys for user interaction.
- [x] Use of lighting.

## How to Run <a name="how-to-run"></a>

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed. If not, you can download it from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

2. Open your terminal and navigate to the project's directory.

3. Run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will install the necessary dependencies and start the development server.

## Dependencies <a name="dependencies"></a>

This project relies on the following dependencies:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)

Make sure you have these dependencies installed before running the project.

## Video Demonstration <a name="video-demonstration"></a>
