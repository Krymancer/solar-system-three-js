# Solar system using Three.js

## Requiriments

  - [x] Use of geometric transformations and textures for each celestial body
  - [x] Present the objects referring to the planets and sun
  - [x] Apply the maximum of objects referring to the Solar System in the scene (Saturn can present its rings with the same texture resource shown in the classroom, but the satellites of each of the planets will be disregarded for this work)
  - [x] Apply the translation of the planets around the Sun (using keys)
  - [x] Planets perform their own rotation around itself
  - [x] Include project on GitHub and in README add link to video demonstration on Youtube showing the operation of the 3D scene

## Optional

  - [x] Efficient representation of Saturn's rings
  - [x] Representation of some satellite samples
  - [x] Planets move at different speeds
  - [x] Trigger keys for user interaction
  - [x] Use of lighting
